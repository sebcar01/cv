      in town, and since then I've been in love with this sport.</li>
    <li><strong>Videogames:</strong> Along with my passion with computers I acquire
      this other passion for videogames, starting from flight simulators like FS98,
      driving games like Midtown Madness 2, all the way to the FPS, being Rainbow Six Siege
